- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Andreas Kuhn a physicist and phd-student at the CCTB (Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology) at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. 
- Iâ€™m interested in agent based modeling, collective phenomena on small scales and image analysis. All of this stuff is mainly done in the programming language Julia.

- If you're interested in learning Julia you can take a look at this course i have designed https://github.com/AndreasKuhn-ak/WS2022_Julia .
