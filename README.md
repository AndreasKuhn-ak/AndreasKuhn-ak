ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andreas Kuhn, a physicist and Ph.D. student at the Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology (CCTB) at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.

I'm interested in agent-based modeling, collective phenomena on small scales, and image analysis. Most of my work is done using the programming language Julia.

If you're interested in learning Julia, you can check out this (course)[https://github.com/AndreasKuhn-ak/WS2022_Julia] I've designed for the students in my group.
